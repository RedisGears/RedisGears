## What is RedisGears?
RedisGears is a serverless engine for transaction, [batch](overview.md#batch-processing) and [event-driven](overview.md#event-processing) data processing in Redis. It is a dynamic framework for the execution of [functions](functions.md) that, in turn, implement data flows in Redis, while (almost) entirely abstracting the data's distribution and choice of deployment  (i.e. stand-alone vs. cluster, OSS vs. Enterprise). Functions can be implemented in different languages, including Python and C [APIs](overview.md#api).

## Where Next?
  * The [Introduction](intro.md) is the recommended starting point
  * The [Overview](overview.md) page summarizes the concepts used by RedisGears
  * The reference pages about RedisGears' [Runtime](runtime.md), [Functions](functions.md), [Readers](readers.md) and [Operations](operations.md)
  * The RedisGears [Commands](commands.md) reference
  * The [Quickstart](quickstart.md) page provides information about getting, building, installing and running RedisGears
  * There are interesting uses and RedisGears recipes in the [Examples](examples.md)
