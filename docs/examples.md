## Word Count
The counting of words.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Assumptions**

All keys store Redis String values. Each value is a sentence.

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/word-count.py') }}
```

## Delete by Key Prefix
Deletes all keys whose name begins with a specified prefix and return their count.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Assumptions**

There may be keys in the database. Some of these may have names beginning with the "delete_me:" prefix.

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/del-by-prefix.py') }}
```

## Average on age field in json
Calculates the average `age` scanning all JSON docs keys that start with prefix `docs`

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Assumptions**

[Json module](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisjson/) is also loaded to Redis

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/json-avg.py') }}
```

## Basic Redis Stream Processing

Copy every new message from a Redis Stream to a Redis Hash key.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Assumptions**

An input Redis Stream is stored under the "mystream" key.

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/stream-logger.py') }}
```

## Automatic Expiry

Sets the time to live (TTL) for every updated key to one hour.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/automatic-expire.py') }}
```

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

## Keyspace Notification Processing

This example demonstrates a two-step process that:

1. Synchronously captures distributed keyspace events
1. Asynchronously processes the events' stream

Specifically, the example shows how expired key names can be output to the log.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

```python
{{ include('examples/notification-processing.py') }}
```

## Reliable Keyspace Notification

Capture each keyspace event and store to a Stream

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/reliable-keyspace-notification.py') }}
```

## Distributed Monte Carlo to Estimate _pi_

Estimate _pi_ by throwing darts at a carefully-constructed dartboard.

!!! tip "There are far better ways to get Pi's value"
    This example is intended for educational purposes only. For all practical purposes, you'd be better off using the constant value 3.14159265359.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/monte-carlo-pi.py') }}
```
