## Word Count
The counting of words.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Assumptions**

All keys store Redis String values. Each value is a sentence.

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/word-count.py') }}
```

## Delete by Key Prefix
Deletes all the keys with name beginning with a prefix and return their count.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Assumptions**

There may be keys in the database. Some of these may have names beginning with the "delete_me:" prefix.

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/del-by-prefix.py') }}
```

## Basic Redis Stream Processing

Copy every new message from the Redis Stream to a Redis Hash key.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Assumptions**

An input Redis Stream is stored under the "mystream" key.

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/stream-logger.py') }}
```

## Automatic Expiry

Sets the time to live (TTL) for every updated key to one hour.

**Author: [RedisLabs](https://redislabs.com/)**

**Python API**

```python
{{ include('examples/automatic-expire.py') }}
```

## Distributed Monte Carlo Estimation of Pi's Value

Estimate Pi by throwing darts at a carefully-constructed dartboard.

!!! tip "There are far better ways to get Pi's value"
    This example is intended for educational purposes only. For all practical purposes, you'd be better off using the constant value of 3.14159265359.
