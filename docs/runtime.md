# RedisGears Functions Runtime

Python RedisGears functions are run using an embedded Python interpreter. Each function uses a separate sub-interpreter. All functions share the same environment and dependencies. The environment is imported with several defaults.

The following sections describe the runtime environment.

## Python Interpreter
RedisGears embeds a Python version 3.7.2+ interpreter.

All functions use this interpreter. Each call to `RG.PYEXECUTE` maintains its own globals dictionary that isolates its execution context from other calls. This means that all of the functions submitted in a given call share the same interpreter and globals dictionary.

    For more information refer to:

      * [Isolation Techniques design](isolation.md)

## Environment
The interpreter's environment can be extended with any dependent package that can later be imported and used by functions in their respective sub-interpreters.

!!! info "Further reference"
    For more information about installing dependencies refer to:

      * [The `REQUIREMENTS` argument of `RG.PYEXECUTE`](commands.md#rgpyexecute)
      * [The QuickStart's Python Virtual Environment section](quickstart.md#python-virtual-environment)

## GearsBuilder
The `GearsBuilder` class is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

It exposes the functionality of the function's [context builder](functions.md#context-builder).

## execute
The `execute()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function executes an arbitrary Redis command.

!!! info "Further reference"
    For more information about Redis commands refer to:

      * [Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands)

**Python API**

```python
def execute(command, *args)
```

_Arguments_

* _command_: the command to execute
* _args_: the command's arguments

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/execute.py') }}
```

## atomic
The `atomic()` Python context is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

The context ensures that all operations in it are executed atomically by blocking the main Redis process.

**Python API**

```python
class atomic()
```

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/atomic.py') }}
```

## configGet
The `configGet()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function fetches the current value of a RedisGears [configuration](#configuration.md) option.

**Python API**

```python
def configGet(key)
```

_Arguments_

* _key_: the configuration option key

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/configget.py') }}
```

## gearsConfigGet
The `gearsConfigGet()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function fetches the current value of a RedisGears [configuration](configuration.md) option and returns a default value if that key does not exist.

**Python API**

```python
def gearsConfigGet(key, default=None)
```

_Arguments_

* _key_: the configuration option key
* _default_: a default value

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/gearsconfigget.py') }}
```

## hashtag
The `hashtag()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function returns a hashtag that maps to the lowest hash slot served by the local engine's shard. Put differently, it is useful as a hashtag for partitioning in a cluster.

**Python API**

```python
def hashtag()
```

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/hashtag.py') }}
```

## log
The `log()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function prints a message to Redis' log.

**Python API**

```python
def log(message, level='notice')
```

_Arguments_

* _message_: the message to output
* _level_: the message's log level can be one of these:
    * **'debug'**
    * **'verbose'**
    * **'notice'**
    * **'warning'**

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/log.py') }}
```

## gearsFuture
The `gearsFuture()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function returns a `gearsFuture` object, which allows another thread/process to process the record. Returning this object from a step's operation tells RedisGears to suspend execution until background processing had finished/failed.

The `gearsFuture` object provides two control methods: `continueRun()` and `continueFailed()`. Both methods are thread-safe and can be called at any time to signal that the background processing has finished. `continueRun` signals success and its argument is a record for the main process. `continueFailed` reports a failure to the main process and its argument is a string describing the failure.

Calling `gearsFuture()` is supported only from the context of the following operations:
* `map`
* `flatmap`
* `filter`
* `foreach`
* `aggregate`
* `aggregateby`

An attempt to create a `gearsFuture` object outside of the supported contexts will result in an exception.

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/gearsFuture.py') }}
```

### gearsFuture with Python Async Await
`gearsFuture` is also integrated seamlessly with Python's async/await syntax, so it possible to do the following:

```python
{{ include('runtime/async.py') }}
```
