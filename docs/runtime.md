# RedisGears Functions Runtime

Python RedisGears functions are run using an embedded Python interpreter. Each function uses a separate sub-interpreter. All functions share the same environment and dependencies. The environment is imported with several defaults.

The following sections describe the runtime environment.

## Python Interpreter
RedisGears embeds a Python version 3.7.2+ interpreter.

All functions use this interpreter. Each call to `RG.PYEXECUTE` maintains its own globals dictionary that isolates its execution context from other calls. This means that all of the functions submitted in a given call share the same interpreter and globals dictionary.

!!! info "Further reference"
    For more information refer to:

      * [Isolation Techniques design](isolation.md)

## Environment
The interpreter's environment can be extended with any dependent package that can later be imported and used by functions in their respective sub-interpreters.

!!! info "Further reference"
    For more information about installing dependencies refer to:

      * [The `REQUIREMENTS` argument of `RG.PYEXECUTE`](commands.md#rgpyexecute)
      * [The QuickStart's Python Virtual Environment section](quickstart.md#python-virtual-environment)

## GearsBuilder
The `GearsBuilder` class is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

It exposes the functionality of the function's [context builder](functions.md#context-builder).

## execute
The `execute()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function executes an arbitrary Redis command.

!!! info "Further reference"
    For more information about Redis commands refer to:

      * [Redis commands](https://redis.io/commands)

**Python API**

```python
def execute(command, *args)
```

_Arguments_

* _command_: the command to execute
* _args_: the command's arguments

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/execute.py') }}
```

## atomic
The `atomic()` Python context is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

The context ensures that all operations in it are executed atomically by blocking the main Redis process.

**Python API**

```python
class atomic()
```

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/atomic.py') }}
```

## configGet
The `configGet()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function fetches the current value of a RedisGears [configuration](#configuration.md) option.

**Python API**

```python
def configGet(key)
```

_Arguments_

* _key_: the configuration option key

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/configget.py') }}
```

## gearsConfigGet
The `gearsConfigGet()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function fetches the current value of a RedisGears [configuration](configuration.md) option and returns a default value if that key does not exist.

**Python API**

```python
def gearsConfigGet(key, default=None)
```

_Arguments_

* _key_: the configuration option key
* _default_: a default value

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/gearsconfigget.py') }}
```

## hashtag
The `hashtag()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function returns a hashtag that maps to the lowest hash slot served by the local engine's shard. Put differently, it is useful as a hashtag for partitioning in a cluster.

**Python API**

```python
def hashtag()
```

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/hashtag.py') }}
```

## log
The `log()` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function prints a message to Redis' log.

**Python API**

```python
def log(message, level='notice')
```

_Arguments_

* _message_: the message to output
* _level_: the message's log level can be one of these:
    * **'debug'**
    * **'verbose'**
    * **'notice'**
    * **'warning'**

**Examples**

```python
{{ include('runtime/log.py') }}
```

## Async Await

For a full explination about async await look at [Async Await Support](intro.md#async-await-support)

### createFuture
The `createFuture` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function returns a `gearsFuture` object, which can be waited on using `await` inside a coroutine.

**Python API**

```python
def createFuture()
```

### setFutureResults
The `setFutureResults` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function allows set a result on a future object returned from [createFuture](runtime#createFuture)

**Python API**

```python
def setFutureResults(f, res)
```

_Arguments_

* f: future object to set the result on.
* res: the result to set on the future object.

### setFutureException
The `setFutureException` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function allows set an exception on a future object returned from [createFuture](runtime#createFuture)

**Python API**

```python
def setFutureException(f, ex)
```

_Arguments_

* f: future object to set the result on.
* ex: the exception to set on the future object.

### runCoroutine
The `runCoroutine` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function allows run a coroutine in a dedicated event loop.

**Python API**

```python
def runCoroutine(cr, f=None, delay=0)
```

_Arguments_

* cr: coroutine to run.
* f: future object to set the coroutine result on (if none the result are ignored).
* delay: delay (in seconds) to start the coroutine.

### isAsyncAllow
The `isAsyncAllow` function is imported to the runtime's environment by default.

This function allows to know if async await can be used in the current execution, for more info refer to [sync with multi exec](async_await_advance_topics.md#sync-with-multi-exec).

**Python API**

```python
def isAsyncAllow()
```
