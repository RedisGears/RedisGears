RedisGears is a serverless engine for transaction, batch and event-driven data processing in Redis. It is a dynamic framework for the execution of functions that, in turn, implement data flows in Redis, while (almost) entirely abstracting the data's distribution and choice of deployment  (i.e. stand-alone vs. cluster, OSS vs. Enterprise). Functions can be implemented in different languages, including Python and C APIs.
